### Hi there, I'ts Adwaith Rajesh.

## I'm a Student and a Developer!
- 🔭 I’m currently working on Nothing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Science 🤣, OS development
- 🥅 2022 Goals: Contribute more to Open Source projects
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can forget to eat but not to code.


### A little bit about me.

I'm a student having an interest in programming and everything tech. My favourite language is Python.
And I believe that someday I can change the world.
I like to work really low level stuff, this include messing with language like C, ASM, and building tools and such.
If you are interseted in any of this.. let's talk 😄
