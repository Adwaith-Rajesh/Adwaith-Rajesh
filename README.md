### A little bit about me.
Hey! 👋 I'm a student who's crazy about programming, especially Python. I dream of changing the world someday. I love diving into low-level stuff like C and ASM, and building tools from scratch—it's like solving puzzles for fun!

Oh, and I'm also super into data science and machine learning. Turning data into insights feels like unlocking secrets. If you're into any of this, let's chat! 😄

I'm currently working on.
