### Hi there, I'ts Adwaith Rajesh.

## I'm a Student and a Developer!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [LinearML](https://github.com/Adwaith-Rajesh/LinearML).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Science.
- ðŸ¥… 2024 Goals: Contribute more to Open Source projects
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can forget to eat but not to code.

### A little bit about me.
Hey! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a student who's crazy about programming, especially Python. I dream of changing the world someday. I love diving into low-level stuff like C and ASM, and building tools from scratchâ€”it's like solving puzzles for fun!

Oh, and I'm also super into data science and machine learning. Turning data into insights feels like unlocking secrets. If you're into any of this, let's chat! ðŸ˜„

There are projects that I'm currently working on.
